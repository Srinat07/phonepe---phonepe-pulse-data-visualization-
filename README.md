With over 45% market share, PhonePe’s data is representative of the country’s digital payment habits


PhonePe, one of India’s leading fintech platform has announced today, the launch of 'PhonePe Pulse'. It is India’s first interactive website with data, insights and trends on digital payments in the country. The PhonePe Pulse website showcases more than 2000+ Crore transactions by consumers on an interactive map of India.
The company also launched the Pulse Report, an in-depth study on the evolution of digital payments over the past 5 years. It includes detailed geographical and category specific trends. The report is available as a free download on the PhonePe Pulse website.


Sameer Nigam, Founder and CEO of PhonePe said, “The Pulse website and report is our way of giving back to the digital payments ecosystem. When we started PhonePe, we struggled to get reliable granular data on digital payments trends across the country. We had promised ourselves that if we are successful and gather enough data on our platform, we would open it. We built 'Pulse' because we can, and because we plan to unlock opportunities for others to build in India.
